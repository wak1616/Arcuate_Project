    <h1 class="py-2">About De Rojas AI Calc</h1>

    <p>Arcuate incisions of the cornea (aka arcuate keratotomies) are used in ophthalmic surgery to treat astigmatism during cataract surgery 
      and lens exchange procedures. They are a powerful tool, but there is little medical consensus on how to
      best employ them, how to create them (via a femtosecond laser? manual blades?), or how to fine-tune them
      for specific levels of astigmatism and/or patient biometrics or demographics.  The author Joaquin De Rojas, MD (creator of this website) 
      has extensive experience in employing these "arcuate keratotomies" to improve visual outcomes for his patients</p>

    <p> There have been multiple published models or "nomograms" to help guide surgeons in how to best make these
      incisions (i.e. how long do you make them? how far from the center of the cornea? How deep?) There are links to these 
      prior published models under "Links" in the navigation bar at the top of the webage.
    </p>

    <p> The current nomogram (De Rojas AI Calc) has been developed using insights gained from the Donnenfeld limbal relaxing
      incisions nomogram as well as the Wortz-Gupta Calculator (both available online).  In addition, it has been tweaked by the author Dr. De Rojas
      to help predict his real world results.  The nomogram does make a series of assumptions that are as follows: 
      <ul>
        <li> The ALLYÂ® Adaptive Cataract Treatment System (LensAR, Inc)is used to make laser arcuate incisions </li>
        <li> Arcuate incisions are made at 80% depth </li>
        <li> Arcuate incisions are made at at 4.5mm radius (9.0mm diamter) from the visual center </li>
        <li> All acruate incisions were opened at the time of surgery with a BSS irrigation cannula</li>
        <li> Low levels of astigmatism (.3) will not be treated and higher levels of astigmatism (>1.25) will not be
          treated with arcuates (because the author believes such high amounts of astigmatism are best treated with toric lenses instead)</li>
        <li> "Against-the-rule astigmatism" (i.e. steep axis at 180 degrees) will be treated more aggressively that "With-the-rule
          astigmatism" (i.e. steep axis at 090 degrees).</li>
        <li> Surgically induced astigmatism (SIA) from the surgeon's main incision will be minimal</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>  
      The hope of the author is to create future versions of this nomogram that will leverage even larger data sets and artificial 
      intelligence to further increase its accuracy.
